# Evolution of Software Industry and Roles – Part 2

## Recap from Part 1
In Part 1, we explored the history of the software industry, from the 1950s invention of software to the emergence of system and application software, the rise of IT services and product-based companies.

In this part, we continue the journey by discussing key events, technological revolutions, new roles in the industry, and how software has evolved into the cloud and AI era.

## Dot-Com Bubble and Y2K

### Dot-Com Bubble (Late 1990s–2000)
- Early 2000s saw a boom in internet-based startups ("dot-coms").
- Websites were launched for nearly every idea (e.g., flowers.com, cars.com).
- Infrastructure (like online banking or logistics) wasn't ready to support this boom.
- Many startups failed within a year, leading to the "dot-com crash."
- Result: mass layoffs and investor losses.

### Y2K Bug
- From 1950s–1980s, computers stored year with only **two digits** (e.g., 70 instead of 1970).
- Concern: what would happen when year turned from 99 to 00 in 2000?
- Systems might read 00 as 1900, causing calculation errors in banking, military, etc.
- **Result**: billions spent on remediation; millions of jobs created to fix software.

## Rise of Cloud Computing

### On-Premise to Cloud
- Earlier: companies stored software and servers on-site (**on-premise**).
- Cloud providers like **Amazon, Microsoft, Google** changed the game.

### Cloud Service Models
1. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** – Developers build apps without managing hardware.
2. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** – Complete applications delivered via the internet.

### Benefits
- No need for local servers or infrastructure.
- Software can be deployed and scaled instantly.

## Mobile Revolution (Post-2004)

- Mobile phones became affordable and accessible.
- Smartphones = mini computers with OS, apps, and hardware.
- Revolutionized user accessibility — even street vendors use mobile apps today.

### Client-Server Evolution
- Client could now be a **PC, Mac, tablet, or smartphone**.
- Server still hosted main logic and data.
- Enabled large-scale B2C (Business to Consumer) innovation.

## Modern Infrastructure: Cloud & AI

### Cloud Credits
- Students and startups can now deploy apps using free credits (e.g., $100 AWS credit).

### AI Revolution
- AI has existed for decades, but has now become **affordable and accessible**.
- Libraries and tools are democratized — usable by small teams or individuals.
- Breakthrough: **LLMs (Large Language Models)** like ChatGPT.

### AI Use Cases
- **Traffic Violation Detection** using AI cameras.
- **Manufacturing QC**: detecting defects via AI cameras on conveyor belts.
- **Banking**: fraud detection, spam filtering.

> AI is expected to **upgrade most existing software**, opening up millions of new jobs.

## Roles in the Modern Software Industry

### 1. Developer / Programmer (60–70%)
- Core of the software industry.
- Writes and maintains application code.

### 2. Product / Program Managers (10–20%)
- Coordinate development.
- Handle client requirements, timelines, and execution.

### 3. QA and Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Done during early or experimental stages.
- **Automation Testing**: Uses scripts to test software repeatedly.

#### Famous Bugs
- **Amazon Bug**: Users added negative quantity to cart and got credited money.
- **NASA Bug**: Mismatch of data types caused a $300M rocket failure.
- **Y2K Bug**: Estimated $300B fix cost globally.

> QA is essential to prevent billion-dollar mistakes.

### 4. SDET (Software Developer in Test)
- Combines development and testing.
- Writes automated test cases in code.

### 5. DevOps
- Automates software deployment and environment setup.
- Builds CI/CD pipelines.

### 6. SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)
- Ensures uptime and performance.
- Handles monitoring, alerts, and disaster recovery.

### 7. Cybersecurity Experts
- Protect systems against hacks, data breaches, and cyber attacks.

## Industry Takeaway
- Software has become essential to every business sector — agriculture, banking, retail, logistics.
- Mobile, cloud, and AI revolutions have created waves of new jobs and roles.
- Testing, DevOps, and AI integration are now core to modern software projects.

> We're at the edge of a new AI-driven revolution that will redefine the industry once again.
