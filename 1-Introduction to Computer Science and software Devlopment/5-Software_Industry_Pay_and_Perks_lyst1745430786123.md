Just like nurses, doctors, and surgeons earn differently based on skills, time invested, and expertise — software roles also vary greatly in learning curve and pay.

### Factors Influencing Pay
- **Time to Master**: High-paying roles need deeper knowledge and experience.
- **Learning Ability**: Students from top colleges often learn faster and are more productive early on.
- **Skill Depth**: Ability to grasp complex systems, code efficiency, and communication all matter.

## Industry Type: Product vs. Service Companies

### Service Companies
- **Business Model**: B2B outsourcing model.
- **Code Ownership**: Belongs to the client.
- **Margins**: Typically 20–30%.
- **Engineer Role**: Project-based, client-defined tech stacks.

### Product Companies
- **Business Model**: B2C or reusable B2B products.
- **Code Ownership**: Owned and reused internally.
- **Margins**: Often exceed 50%, sometimes 90%.
- **Engineer Role**: Solve complex, large-scale problems.

> Product companies tend to pay more due to ownership, scale, and innovation needs.
