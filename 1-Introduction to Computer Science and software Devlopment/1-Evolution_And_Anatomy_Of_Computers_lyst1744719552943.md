## Evolution of Computers

### The Early Days

Computers have undergone a fascinating transformation. Initially, they were massive machines, often occupying entire rooms (e.g., 10 ft by 10 ft).

- Input and output were mechanical.
- Calculations were physical and extremely specific.
- Used primarily for scientific research and calculations, such as space mission computations.

**Example:** Calculating the trajectory of rockets in early space missions required thousands of trials and computations.

### Specialized Machines

These early computers were:

- Purpose-built (goal defined during manufacturing).
- Used only for specific tasks, much like a fan or pen cannot perform functions beyond its design.

Due to their high cost, only research institutions and well-funded labs could afford them.

### Rise of General-Purpose Computers

A major breakthrough was the development of **general-purpose computers**:

- Not limited by initial manufacturing purpose.
- Could be programmed later for different tasks (e.g., accounting, gaming, communication).
- Enabled by the invention of **programming languages**.

#### Analogy: LEGO Blocks

General-purpose processors are like LEGO blocks:

- Fixed-design toys = purpose-specific computers.
- LEGO blocks = general-purpose computers (customizable via programming).

### Microprocessors and Evolution

- **First microprocessors**: Intel 8085 and 8086, often taught in CS and Electronics courses.
- Instruction sets allowed basic operations via programming.

### Processor Families

- **Intel x86**
- **ARM architecture**

Used in everything from personal computers to smartphones.

#### Computer Manufacturers:

- **Microsoft**: Focused on software and OS.
- **Apple**: Controlled the full stack – motherboard, processor, OS.

### Modern Computing Landscape

- **Personal Computers**: Laptops and desktops using Intel, AMD, Apple (M1, M2, M3).
- **Servers**: Same architecture, but with higher core counts (up to 100+ cores).

### Ubiquity of Computers

Modern computers are everywhere:

- Phones, watches, traffic systems.
- Used in edge computing, AI-powered monitoring (e.g., traffic violation detection).
- Growing presence in Industry 4.0/5.0 and IoT (Internet of Things).

### Future of Computing

- Software spending expected to double (from 5% to 10% of global GDP).
- Increasing demand for software engineers.
- Penetration into sectors like education, banking, healthcare, defense, agriculture, and manufacturing.

This is still the early phase of the software revolution, and opportunities abound.

## Anatomy of a Computer

To understand how computers work, we must know their parts. This helps us see where programs run and how hardware behavior affects software design.

### Key Components

1. **CPU Cabinet**: Enclosure containing all major parts.
2. **Motherboard**: Main circuit board.
   - Hosts the processor and other components.
3. **Processor (CPU)**:
   - The brain of the computer.
   - Executes instructions from software.

### Input/Output Devices

- **Input**: Keyboard, mouse, microphone, scanner.
- **Output**: Monitor, speakers, printer.

### Storage and Memory

- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary, fast-access memory for active tasks.
- **Storage (HDD/SSD)**: Long-term storage for files and software.

### Other Components

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: Converts electricity to usable power.
- **Cooling Systems**: Fans or liquid cooling to regulate temperature.

## Operating System (OS)

An OS is system software that:

- Manages hardware resources.
- Provides a user interface.
- Acts as a bridge between hardware and applications.

### Common Operating Systems

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)

### OS Responsibilities

- Process Management
- Memory Management
- File System Handling
- Device Management
- User Interface

## Viewing System & Process Info (Basic Commands)

### Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
systeminfo
```

Displays detailed configuration info.

```cmd
tasklist
```

Shows running processes.

### Linux/macOS (Terminal)

```bash
uname -a
```

System info.

```bash
top
```

Live view of processes.

```bash
ps aux
```

Detailed process list.

## Software and How It Works

### What is Software?

A set of instructions (programs) that tell the computer what to do.

### Types of Software

1. **System Software**: OS and utility programs.
2. **Application Software**: Word processors, browsers, games, etc.

### How Software Runs

- Written in high-level languages (e.g., Python, C++, Java).
- Compiled or interpreted into machine code.
- Loaded into memory and executed by the processor.

## Summary

- Computers evolved from room-sized, mechanical machines to today's compact, powerful systems.
- General-purpose processors revolutionized computing.
- Computers are now in every industry and nearly every device.
- Understanding computer anatomy helps in building better software.
- The operating system is the middle layer between hardware and apps.

Stay curious and observant — the software revolution is still unfolding, and there's much more to explore!
